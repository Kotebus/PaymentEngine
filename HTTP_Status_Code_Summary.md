### HTTP Status Code Summary

| 200                | OK                         | Everything worked as expected.                                                                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 400                | Bad Request                | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.                         |
| 401                | Unauthorized               | No valid API key provided.                                                                       |
| 402                | Request Failed             | The parameters were valid but the request failed.                                                |
| 403                | Forbidden                  | The API key doesn’t have permissions to perform the request.                                     |
| 404                | Not Found                  | The requested resource doesn’t exist.                                                            |
| 409                | Conflict                   | The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key).       |
| 424                | External Dependency Failed | The request couldn’t be completed due to a failure in a dependency external to Stripe.           |
| 429                | Too Many Requests          | Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests. |
| 500, 502, 503, 504 | Server Errors              | Something went wrong on Stripe’s end. (These are rare.)                                          |
